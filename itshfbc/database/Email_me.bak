This software is available as freeware via the Internet.

As of Feb 2005 I have retired from the US government.
I now maintain this software at no cost as a "Labor of Love".

The software is now maintained on my personal website:
   www.greg-hand.com/hf.html

Users who require special enhancements to the software for their
own needs may contact me.  If the changes are not "trivial",
I may be persuaded with $$$ to cover my golf addiction.

I hope this HF software is useful to you.
